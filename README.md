Foodle

Foodle is an app that calls on the Spoonacular API for recipes and ingredients. A user types ingredients he or she already has, and Foodle will return recipes containing those ingredients. This app is ideal for someone who wants to learn how to cook but might not know where to begin. It's also great for someone who just wants to know what kind of recipes they can make with the ingredients they already have. After the user searches for recipes, they will see a list of recipes before them. They can click on these recipes to get more information about cooking times and ingredients. The user can click on the source name of the recipe to be redirected to the website where the recipe is hosted. My philosophy is that cooking at home is both more fun and tastes better than going out, and Foodle is a great place to start the cooking journey.
